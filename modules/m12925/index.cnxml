<title>Parent Involvement</title>

<para id="id12104916">Literature supports the notion that parent involvement has a positive impact on student achievement and success in school. Parent involvement is not only incremental in the development of the child but also motivates the schools to function at a higher standard by constantly improving practices.The question for many school administrators is how a principal goes about the process of improving school and parent relations so that the student will have improved learning outcomes.</para>
<para id="id12899768">First, a climate of trust and collaboration between the school and parents is essential for effective planning to establish effective parent involvement programs. A principal must ensure that effective communication is in place and that parents know that their participation in school matters and is critical to student success.</para>
<para id="id12899889">Second, recognize that there is no "cookie cutter" for parental involvement. Each school's requirements will be different, and will be driven by different strengths, and backgrounds, such as its history, culture and climate and student performance. A careful needs assessment and knowledge of the norms and values must be studied before a plan is agreed upon by the stakeholders of the school.</para>

<para id="id13215339">Third, parent involvement is often thought of
as a means to raise money or plan special school activities but in
reality parent involvement includes any number of activities
including reading with children, tutoring, and in some cases
monitoring the cafeteria! There is evidence in the literature that
validates that most parents would like to be involved with the
school but need some direction from school personnel on how to help
(Epstein &amp; Jansorn, 2004). Some parent may even need training
on how they can help their child with their homework math and
reading skills, science fair projects and other academic
activities. The important thing is to encourage involvement from
parents in whatever form or fashion that they can provide.</para>

<title>Rationale</title>

<para id="id13149295">Parents need to know that whatever they can
give in terms of time or resources is appreciated and that it is
important to the academic and social/emotional development of the
child. When parents value education and show it through encouraging
their child and supporting the school the student realizes the
importance of the school and learning. Most people may think that
parent involvement describes only those parents that give time at
the school or attend all the activities. In reality parent
involvement is much more.</para>

<para id="id13117506">Christie (2005) identifies volunteering at the school to be on the lowest rung on the ladder of potential activities for parent involvement. However, its importance should not be trivialized as it does have a positive impact on the student achievement and esteem. Children like to see parents at school and teachers appreciate the hands-on help they get from parents. Christie ranks attendance at school conferences and activities the next lowest on her ladder of importance followed by participation on committees, tutoring and reading one-on-one. More important is that parents make their student accountable for homework, supplying them a good study environment and making sure that they attend school everyday. The highest level of involvement, in Christie's view, is parents having high
expectations for their kids in terms of academics and behavior. The
parent that admonishes their student that trouble at school means
â€œdouble trouble at homeâ€ helps to focus their student on being successful and taking advantage of the instruction of the teachers. It is absolutely imperative that students present themselves at school with the appropriate disposition to learn. Anything less will result in lower academic performance. Principals should look closely at the relationships between the teachers, the parents and the community. If schools and parents are connected then there will be a solid relationship, stable attendance at conferences and meetings, parents willing to help, varied methods of communication and materials, collaborative relations between home and school and finally communication between parties is successful. With these elements in place the school and home are connected and the outlook for parent involvement is promising (Wherry, 2005).</para>

<para id="id13031870">While these are the signs of a connection
between home and school, research from The Parent Institute (2005)
showed that teachers and parents often do not rate the significance
of parent involvement options in the same way. When asked to rank
in order of importance the things parents can do at home to help
their child do better in school, teacher and parents had very
different views. Teachers thought that the most important thing
they can do is to read with their children while parents felt that
talking to their children was the most important thing they could
do (Wherry, 2005).</para>

<para id="id13180246">This illustrates the wide range of
interpretations of the notion of parent involvement. We can learn
from this that parents and schools need to establish goals together
to effectively meet the needs of the children. Administrators,
teachers and parents need to communicate and clarify expectations
so that programs can be developed that effectively address student
success initiatives. When these parties have agreed upon
expectations and have established mutual goals and values then the
parties become truly connected. The move towards higher standards,
greater accountability and additional and more difficult assessment
practices requires a commitment from not just school personnel but
families and communities (Machen, Wilson, &amp; Nota 2005).</para>
<para id="id13157768">A study by Nistler and Angela (2000) found
that once schools were able to remove the barriers to parent
participation, involvement increased. Many parents are simply
unable to get to school so efforts need to be increased to
accommodate those who need transportation or have small children
and need childcare. Solutions include carpooling, providing
childcare at the school or forming networks of parents that can
help each other out. Clearly, there is a commonality for improving
and sustaining parent involvement. the development of a
collaborative program that focuses on such things as effective
communication, providing multiple opportunities for involvement,
removing obstacles to involvement and providing parent training
that will increase awareness of the their
child's potential (Machen, Wilson &amp; Notar
2005).</para>

<para id="id13180104">One of the most fundamental ways to improve
the parent school connection is to improve the teacher - parent
relationship. Since teachers are the primary connection with the
school that relationship is critical to student success and parent
involvement. Teachers must learn how to communicate with parents in
an effective and informative way. Evidence exists that when the
initial contact between parent and teacher is positive future
negative incidents will not replace the initial impression
(Million, 2003). By establishing a relationship with parents early
in the year a foundation is built for future involvement. Teachers
must open the door to parent involvement and enlist the help of
parents the first day of school. Having a list of "needs" ready at the Open House or
posted outside the classroom makes parents feel like they are
integral part of the education process. An environment that
welcomes parents in a non-threatening manner enhances the
likelihood that the parents will want to volunteer at the school.
Many schools recruit parents early in the year, sometimes even
before school start.</para>

<para id="id13072065">Principals should identify some of the
parents that are enthusiastic about volunteering and enlist them to
recruit additional parents. A strong parent-teacher organization is
a must for successful school volunteer programs. . These
organizations will plan and organize fundraising events, provide
support for teachers and work to include all parents in the
community. Parent volunteers, with effective leadership can provide
support that can make the school a better place while not being
overly intrusive. The opportunities for parents to help are endless
and the rewards are great for all parties. Schools must make
concerted efforts to nurture parent involvement. By using a variety
of modes of communication from email to flyers to phone calls so
more parents can be reached. Principals and teachers need to be
specific about what their needs are and how parents can best help
the school.</para>
<para id="id12899656">Teachers and administrators must make a
concerted effort to acknowledge the volunteers and show
appreciation for all efforts both large and small. It is imperative
that the principal stay in close communication with those parents
that spearhead volunteer efforts so they can stay knowledgeable of
what is happening. The leaders of the parent groups must have open
lines of communication with the principal. They will know the
status of volunteer efforts and those that are contributing, which
gives the principal an opportunity to recognize those individuals -
contributions must be acknowledged and appreciation must be
extended for parent involvement to be sustained (Hasley,
2004).</para>
